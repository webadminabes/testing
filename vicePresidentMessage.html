      <p>
        My dear students and educators from across the globe, the basic principle of transforming
        society is by transforming Education. The light of Education can illuminate the whole world, and
        in this endeavor, you, our beloved students, and educators, are the torchbearers. Here at
        ABESEC, we are continuously putting efforts into providing a conducive environment so that all
        learn and grow together. In today’s world, the most important thing is to challenge oneself
        each day and earnestly take action to make a better version of yourself.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the years, ABESEC has carved out an identity for itself as an institute that believes in
        developing a student's overall personality into a skilled and socially responsible engineer.
        Academic facilities are state-of-the-art, creating a vibrant learning environment. By learning
        under the guidance of highly rated faculty members, students understand the nuances of the
        engineering domain. We take the learning further by involving industry in the learning process.
        Through our sector connect initiative, we aggressively pursue industry-specific technical
        consultancy opportunities, exposing students to live projects.        
        <br />
        <br />
        Our efforts are well recognized by government bodies and industry alike. We are an NAAC and
        NBA-accredited institute. In 2020, NIRF published a list of the top 250 institutes nationally.        
        <br />
        <br />
        Looking ahead, our vision is clear. We aim to be at the forefront of providing Education that
        meets the current and future needs of the industry. We are determined to seize every
        opportunity that comes our way to bridge the industry-academia gap, not just at the national
        level, but also on the global stage
        <br />
        <br />
        I earnestly wish and pray that we all learn, grow, and advance together.
