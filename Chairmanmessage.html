        We take pride in achieving our target of being a preferred institution
        among the students by building their career path, thereby fulfilling our
        commitments of contributing in the welfare of country, by preparing
        endowed and eminent young minds in the field of Engineering and
        Management. We also admire our stakeholders for achieving excellence in
        academics within a span of 20 years.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our students are nurtured and groomed holistically, thus making them
        competent human resources for the industry and have the ability to think
        beyond academics. We focus on learning, research and innovations rather
        than conventional approach of just scoring marks. We are committed to
        further evolve the institution as a place to foster the talent and
        leadership quality of the young technocrats and managers. Hence, this
        institution strives to instill enthusiasm among the students, support,
        prepare and encourage the students to take up their dream career.
        <br />
        <br />
        It would have been impossible to successfully survive for such a long
        period and achieve these many milestones without the efforts and support
        of a well versed, highly qualified, experienced and dedicated faculty
        members and staff.
        <br />
        <br />
        All these years have witnessed the success story of our institution in
        the form of various achievements and accomplishments by our students. We
        have not only achieved our dream, but also, we have made a place in the
        heart of society as one of the prestigious institutions of our country.
        For me, it’s like a dream come true and I promise that we will continue
        the same legacy for the years to come with more commitments and quality
        and success.
