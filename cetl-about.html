        <i>The Centre</i> of Excellence for Teaching and Learning (CETL), was established to enhance the quality of teaching of
        the faculty at ABES Engineering College. A problem in Engineering education is always felt and remains
        unanswered most of the times that even in the subjects of very experienced faculty, having good command over the
        subject; students could hardly retain 10‐15% of the whole lecture just after a short period of 15‐20 days. These
        problems were found in the DNA part of the teaching process; the very fundamental approach towards teaching. The
        conventional passive teaching methods of lecturing at length were found to be the main cause of these
        problems.<br /><br id="extra-gap">
        ABES wanted to tackle this issue and so decided to establish a dedicated centre named CETL (Centre of Excellence
        for teaching and learning) equipped with the latest technology, tools and supporting infrastructure and a
        committed team to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the teaching learning process at the institute.
        The Centre engages in a range of professional development activities that seek to provide teaching staff with
        the requisite pedagogical skills to improve the learning that takes place in their classrooms, as well as
        strategies for gaining knowledge about trends and developments in learning and teaching in higher education.
